SQL Scripts to perform basic database operations.

# Project Overview

The goal of the project was to create scripts to complete various tasks that performed create, read, update and delete operations on databases and tables. 

## Enhancement Changes

The enhancements made to this project was to create a new SQL script that would perform advanced operations. The script would take data from a csv file and import it into a table, make changes to the data, query data to export to a csv file, and export updated tables from the original csv file.
